# Traffic-classification

I'm gaining an interest in machine learning. So this is a model which I have worked on namely traffic classification. The dataset contains over 50,000 images of different traffic symbols having around
43 classes.
I have used tensorflow.keras library to fit the model and achieved 95% accuracy.
To view the notebook please use the following link [view Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/svdhiren/Traffic-classification/blob/main/Traffic_dataset.ipynb)
To run it, first import kaggle token from your kaggle account into the google colabs directory and then execute the notebook !!
